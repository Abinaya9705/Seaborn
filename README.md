# Seaborn
The code provided successfully imports the necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) and explores three datasets: tips, iris, and titanic using seaborn. Here's a breakdown of what the code does for each dataset:

Tips Dataset:

Loads the tips dataset using sns.load_dataset('tips').
Prints the first few rows (head) and last few rows (tail) of the dataset using pandas functions.
Gets general information about the dataset using info and descriptive statistics using describe (including omitting null values with describe(include='all')).
Checks for missing values using isnull().sum().
Gets the shape of the data using shape.
Creates various pairplots (sns.pairplot) to visualize relationships between variables with different hues (hue) to represent categorical variables (sex, smoker, day, time).
Creates relational plots (sns.relplot) to explore the relationship between total bill and tip, colored by different factors (sex, smoker).
Iris Dataset:

Loads the iris dataset using sns.load_dataset('iris').
Prints the first few rows (head) and last few rows (tail) of the dataset.
Gets general information about the dataset using info.
Gets descriptive statistics using describe.
Checks for missing values using isnull().sum().
Gets the shape of the data using shape.
Creates scatter plots (sns.scatterplot) to visualize relationships between sepal and petal characteristics (length, width), colored by species.
Titanic Dataset:

Loads the titanic dataset using sns.load_dataset('titanic').
Prints the first few rows (head) and last few rows (tail) of the dataset.
Gets the shape of the data using shape.
Checks for missing values using isnull().sum().
Gets general information about the dataset using info.
Gets descriptive statistics using describe (including omitting null values with describe(include='all')).
Creates countplots (sns.countplot) to visualize the distribution of categorical variables (class, who, survived, sex, alone) with different hues for additional comparisons.
Creates bar plots (sns.barplot) to visualize the survival rate across classes and compare survival rates between sexes within each class.
Overall, the code demonstrates how to use seaborn to explore and visualize data from various datasets. It covers techniques like:

Loading datasets with seaborn.
Examining data structure with pandas functions (head, tail, info, describe, isnull, shape).
Creating different plots (pairplots, relplots, scatterplots, countplots, barplots) to visualize relationships and distributions.
Using color coding (hue) to represent categorical variables within plots.
